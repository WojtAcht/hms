Description: 
  The HMS (Hierarchic Memetic Strategy) is a composite global optimization
  strategy consisting of a multi-population evolutionary strategy and some
  auxiliary methods. The HMS makes use of a dynamically-evolving data structure
  that provides an organization among the component populations. It is a tree
  with a fixed maximal height and variable internal node degree. Each component
  population is governed by a particular evolutionary engine. This package
  provides a simple R implementation with examples of using different genetic
  algorithms as the population engines. References: J. Sawicki, M. Łoś,
