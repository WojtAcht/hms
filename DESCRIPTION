Description: 
  The HMS (Hierarchic Memetic Strategy) is a mixture of a multi-deme 
  evolutionary algorithm and gradient-based optimization methods. 
  As a multi-population evolutionary strategy, the HMS 
  makes use of a particular data structure that provides an organization among 
  the sub-populations (demes). It is a tree with a fixed maximal height and 
  variable internal node degree. This package provides a simple R implementation 
  with examples of integrating different genetic algorithms.
